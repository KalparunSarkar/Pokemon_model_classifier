A hilarious attempt at classifying pokemon images using K means clustering

Gotta classify 'em all!

This is a Pokémon Classification Model that attempts to predict which Pokémon you're looking at based on its dominant color. Basically, if Pikachu lost all its shape and became a single blob of color, we'd still recognize it. Pretty cool, right?

Attempts is the key word here - Well, A magikarp could probably guess better
